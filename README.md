Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client was a gaming company that wanted me to develop software so that their game could have the ability to function on a multitude of operating systems. The operating systems they wanted it functional on was Windows, Linux, MacOS, Mobile (android and iOS), and consoles.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

What I did particularly well in developing the documentation was staying open minded and not tied down to certain methods or ways. Looking at opportunities to make everything work and not get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of stuff the client wanted.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The layout of the design document made it feel like it was just a checklist basically. It made it feel less like a project and more like just a standard checklist which made the workload seem smaller that what it really was honestly.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

What I'd like to revise or add I guess if that counts is maybe adding some GUI or something visual to add to the realism of this project.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpretted the user's needs with this design by taking into consideration everything they wanted it and making it transveral between all operating systems. It is important to consider the user's needs for the simple fact that it caters to the users. Without satisfying them your entire project is destined to fail and upset people.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The strategies I would use in the future is maybe getting feedback when creating it or more feedback I should say. The best strategies to get in place are some that I believe a Agile environment would meet. In the future I think I would implement the Agile methology in my next software application.
